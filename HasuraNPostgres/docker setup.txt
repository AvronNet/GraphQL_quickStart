Docker setup

To start the docker images for hasura to work:
docker-compose up -d
To stop the doceker containers:
docker-compose down


To clear the data for the docker container defined in the docker-compose.yaml use:
docker volume prune


- we have to use this becouse the container defines volumes in ht docker-compose file that is used to save the container data for the next startup. 
(if we removed these volumes nothing would persist after removing the container with docker rm container_name)
